# Smart Maintenance Management System

## 📌 Overview
The Smart Maintenance Management System is a full-stack web application designed to digitize and automate the process of handling maintenance requests in institutions such as universities, hostels, apartments, or corporate facilities.

The system provides a centralized platform where users can raise maintenance requests, technicians can manage assigned tasks, and administrators can monitor, assign, and analyze maintenance operations efficiently.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Traditional maintenance management systems rely heavily on manual processes, leading to delayed issue resolution, poor tracking, and lack of accountability. This project aims to eliminate these inefficiencies by providing a role-based, database-driven web solution.

---

## ✅ Features
- Secure user authentication
- Role-based dashboards (Admin, Technician, User)
- Maintenance request submission and tracking
- Technician assignment and task status updates
- Admin analytics and reporting
- Review and feedback system
- Structured and normalized database design

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The project follows a three-tier architecture:

- **Frontend (Presentation Layer):** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend (Application Layer):** PHP
- **Database (Data Layer):** MySQL

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- PHP
- MySQL
- XAMPP (Apache + MySQL)
- Git & GitHub

---

## 🗂️ Project Structure
- frontend/ - User interfaces and dashboards
- backend/ - PHP backend logic and APIs
- assets/ - CSS, JavaScript, images
- database/ - MySQL schema (.sql file)

---

## 🚀 How to Run Locally
1. Install XAMPP
2. Place the project folder inside `htdocs`
3. Start Apache and MySQL from XAMPP Control Panel
4. Import the SQL file from `database/` into phpMyAdmin
5. Access the project via `http://localhost/your-folder-name`

---

## 🌐 Hosting Note
GitHub Pages supports only static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Since this project uses PHP and MySQL, the backend must be run on a server environment such as XAMPP. The complete source code is hosted on GitHub for demonstration and evaluation purposes.

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- Email/SMS notifications
- Cloud deployment
- REST API refactoring
- Mobile-responsive UI
