  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section class="hero-card">
    <h2>Smart Maintenance Management System</h2>

    <p class="lead">
      Smart Maintenance System is a role-based web application built to manage
      maintenance issues in a campus or organization in a simple and efficient way.
    </p>

    <p>
      The system allows students to raise maintenance requests, administrators
      to manage and assign those requests, and technicians to complete the work
      while updating the status. The goal of this project is to reduce manual
      communication and make maintenance tracking clear and organized.
    </p>

  <!-- WHAT THIS DEMO IS -->
  <section class="hero-card">
    <h3>About This Demo Version</h3>

    <p>
      This website shows a <strong>frontend demo version</strong> of the
      Smart Maintenance System and is hosted using <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      GitHub Pages supports only static websites, so the PHP backend and MySQL
      database cannot run here. Because of this, the original PHP pages have been
      converted into static HTML demo pages so that the interface and workflow
      can still be viewed and understood.
    </p>

    <p class="small">
      ▶ The complete working system, including login, database operations, and
      real-time request handling, is fully implemented using
      <strong>PHP and MySQL</strong> and runs locally using
      <strong>XAMPP</strong>.
    </p>
